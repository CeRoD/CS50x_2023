* Luhn's Algorithm
1. Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number
   second-to-last (penultimo), and then add those products' digits together.
2. Add the sum of the sum of the digits that weren't multiplied by 2.
3. If the total's last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total's
   modulo is 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid.

* TODO
a. Prompt for input.
b. Calculate checksum.
c. Check for card length and starting digits.
d. Print AMEX, MASTERCARD, VISA or INVALID.
