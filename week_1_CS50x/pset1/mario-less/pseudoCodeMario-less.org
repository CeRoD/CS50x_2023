#+title: Pseudo Code Mario Less

    1. Ask user for number =height=, should be between 1 and 8.
    2. Print 8 characters: the sum of spaces and " =#= ", should be 8.
       a. first spaces.
          + should know the height first to know how many
            spaces print.
            - in first line print the number of height minus 1.
            - is second line print the number of heigt minus 2.

          + So first print number of spaces minus 1 :: First the =spaces= start
            with the =height=,

            #+begin_src C


            for (int i = height; i <= (height - num_line); i--)
            {
                print(" ");
            }
            #+end_src
       b.
